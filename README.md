## 🇺🇸 Introduction

The 2016 Election Cycle, particularly the presidential race, was marked by significant competition, with candidates investing hundreds of millions in television advertising—though less than the preceding elections. Some attribute this decline to the evolving media landscape favoring digital platforms, while others point to the candidates' already high name recognition. Despite the increasing role of digital advertising, television maintained a dominant share, claiming 70% of total political advertising spending. In total, approximately $2.75 billion was expended on airing over 4.25 million ads across all races in the 2015-2016 election cycle, emphasizing the continued impact of television in political campaigns. Using data from the Political TV Ad Archive, we explored questions around how different television advertising strategies were deployed during the 2016 election cycle.

## ❓ Research Questions
Our research sought to answer three main questions:
1. How did overall advertising strategies differ among the states in the dataset?
2. Did presidential candidates deploy different messaging strategies?
3. How did candidates’ advertising strategies differ in battleground states?

## 🔑 Key Findings 
- There was a large shroud of negativity surrounding both candidates' campaigns. After the primaries, both candidates shifted towards a large percentage of negative advertising, which was mainly focused on the opposing candidate’s “Candidate Biography”. 

- Clinton’s strategy in key battleground states focused on consistent messaging leading up to the election, while Trump’s strategy focused on increasing television advertising during key rallies or events he attended in the state.
